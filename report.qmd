# Introduction

This project uses data provided by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business as part of a data task for a pre-doctoral research position. The data is from a study aiming to understand how the presence or absence of a return apology can affect the way that people feel, and whether these affects vary as a result of one's willingness to apologize first.

## Data Cleaning

A glimpse of the data reveals that all respondents (*N = 61*) consented to participate. Removing participants that did not complete the majority of the survey, give legitimate responses, or pass the attention check resulted in *N = 46* total participants.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apology_data <- read_csv(here("data/apology_data.csv"))

skimr::skim(apology_data)
# consent: n_unique = 1; all responses agreed
# passedattn: n_unique = 2; need to clean responses that did not pass
# Progress: mean = 84.1; need to clean responses that did not answer about feelings

# Task 1

## Initial Data Exploration

There definitely seems to be a significant difference between the feelings of those who do and don't receive return apologies, with the IQR jumping from about (-30,-10) without to (0,20) with. In other words, people feel very bad when they do not get a return apology but feel much better when they do.

This increase varies by initiator type. Interestingly:

- Conditional types experience the **strongest negative reactions** to no return apology (-30,23). 
- Always types roughly flipped from negative (-20,-10) to positive (10,20) when they did not versus did receive a return apology. The distributions remained **very similar**.
- Never types were the **most negative overall** across both scenarios. 

I wonder if these results map onto *agreeableness* as a personality trait then, though everything is likely heavily dependent on by people's lived experiences.

## Question 1

*Do people care about getting a return apology after being the first to apologize?*

We define “whether people care” about getting a return apology as a significant difference in emotional response within participants between the two apology scenarios -- not getting (`feelings_youalone`) and getting (`feelings_bothyoufirst`) a return apology. A pairwise t-test was conducted to compare the two scenarios.
