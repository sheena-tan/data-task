# Introduction
This project uses data provided by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business as part of a data task for a pre-doctoral research position. The data is from a study aiming to understand how the presence or absence of a return apology can affect the way that people feel, and whether these affects vary as a result of one's willingness to apologize first.

# Repository Setup
