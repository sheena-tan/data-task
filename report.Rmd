# Introduction

This data task uses data provided by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business as part of a data task for a pre-doctoral research position. The data is from a study aiming to understand how the presence or absence of a return apology can affect the way that people feel, and whether these affects vary as a result of one's willingness to apologize first.

# Data Cleaning

A glimpse of the data reveals that all respondents (N = 61) consented to participate. Removing participants that did not complete the majority of the survey, give legitimate responses, or pass the attention check resulted in N = 46 total participants.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apology_data <- read_csv(here("data/apology_data.csv"))

skimr::skim(apology_data)
# consent: n_unique = 1; all responses agreed
# passedattn: n_unique = 2; need to clean responses that did not pass
# Progress: mean = 84.1; need to clean responses that did not answer about feelings

## data cleaning ----
apology_clean <- apology_data |>
  filter(IPAddress != "72.83.222.239") |> #see comments field
  filter(Progress > 30) |>
  filter(passedattn == "yes") |>
  select(initiator_type, starts_with("feelings_"), starts_with("outcome_"),
         blame_1, real_imaginary, describe, comments)
```

# Task 1

## Initial Data Exploration

There definitely seems to be a significant difference between the feelings of those who do and don't get return apologies (Task1). There also seems to be significant differences between the different types of people (Task2). I wonder if this maps onto agreeableness personality-wise, or is it more related to people's lived experiences and morals?

```{r, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='left, middle, right', echo = FALSE}
library(here)
library(knitr)
include_graphics(here("results/alone_total.png"))
include_graphics(here("results/both_total.png"))
```
